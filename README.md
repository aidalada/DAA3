# DAA3: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Optimization üèôÔ∏è

This repository contains the solution for Assignment 3, which focuses on optimizing a city's transportation network using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms.

The project implements and compares the efficiency of **Prim's Algorithm** and **Kruskal's Algorithm** to find the minimum cost to connect all districts (vertices) in a weighted graph.

## üíæ Project Structure

The key files in this project are:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `src/main/java/org/example/` | All core Java source files. |
| `Main.java` | The main execution file. It reads the input JSON, runs both MST algorithms, measures performance (time and operations), and writes results to `output.json`. |
| `PrimMST.java` | Implementation of Prim's MST algorithm, including instrumentation to count key operations. |
| `KruskalMST.java` | Implementation of Kruskal's MST algorithm, including instrumentation and a `UnionFind` data structure. |
| `src/main/resources/asign3.json` | **Input Data.** Contains definitions for all test graphs (small, medium, large, sparse, and dense) used for performance analysis. |
| **`output.json`** | **Output Data.** The results file generated by `Main.java`. It contains the total cost, execution time, and operation count for every graph and algorithm. |
| **`Report.pdf`** (or `.docx`) | **Analytical Report.** This document contains the required analysis, tables, performance comparison, and final conclusions (Part 3 of the assignment). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building and Running the Project

This project is built using **Maven**.

### 1\. Prerequisites

You must have the following installed:

  * Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
  * Apache Maven (or use the built-in Maven support in IntelliJ IDEA).

### 2\. Building the Project

Open your terminal in the root directory of the project (where `pom.xml` is located) and run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command downloads necessary dependencies (like Gson and JUnit) and compiles the project.

### 3\. Running the Analysis

To execute the algorithms, read the input data, and generate the results:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.Main"
```

After successful execution, the **`output.json`** file will be created in the project root directory.

## ‚úÖ Verification

The project includes automated tests (`MSTTest.java`) to verify the correctness of the MST algorithms.

To run the tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

## üìù Submitting the Assignment

The final submission consists of the full source code and the analytical report. Please ensure the following files are present in the repository:

1.  All Java source files (`*.java`)
2.  `pom.xml`
3.  `asign3.json`
4.  **`output.json`** (The generated results)
5.  **`Report.pdf`** (The analytical report)
